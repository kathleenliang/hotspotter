# Hotspotter
Hotspotter is a centralized web platform for vaccine seekers living in Ontario hotspots. The platform provides a quick and easy way for users to check if they’re eligible for the vaccine. With a database of pop-up clinics, we enable users to find nearby locations to book a vaccination appointment. Hotspotter’s database relies on user input from Twitter accounts & Discord server. So on our platform, we’ve added another way for users to submit pop up clinic locations. To address potential issues in reliability, we have implemented an upvote system in combination with human moderation to ensure trustworthiness in our system.
